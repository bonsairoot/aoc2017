# Advent of code
## What is aoc?
Advent of code is a daily challenge lasting through the advent.  
See: http://adventofcode.com/ for more informations.  
There is also a [subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/adventofcode/) where people are posting and discussing their solutions.

## What is my strategy?
I am not participating with the goal to get as many points as possible. I will probably miss quite a lot of days and post  
my solutions rather late in the day. The main goal is to get more familiar with interesting languages and to improve my coding  
skills in general.

## What languages am I using and why?
I will mainly be using:

- **Haskell**  
  - Though I have a bit of experience with functional programming (Elixir, Scala) I've never learned Haskell. It's something that has been on my todo-list for a while now. This is why I chose it for AOC 2017.
- **Python3**    
  - It's a language that is just fun to write in. 
- **Perl maybe?**    
  - Anything related to heavy text processing is probably going to end up being written in perl

## Feedback
If any scripts look like a huge mess it's probably because I've rushed them and didn't have the time and/or motivation for refactoring.
I will revisit them and do some cleanup at some point. Feel free to give me feedback on my solutions if you see me posting in the subreddit. I appreciate every advice given to me.
